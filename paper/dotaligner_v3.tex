\abstract{Non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are the prevalent transcriptional
product of higher eukaryote genomes. Their varied biological functions are
governed by both their sequence composition and their higher-order structural
conformation. The uncertainty of secondary structure prediction algorithms for
single RNA sequences in conjunction with the limited diversity of
well-characterised RNA structures have restricted the identification and
annotation of novel functional ncRNA domains.  Here, we present a unified
computational methodology for the identification of common RNA secondary
structures from a set of sequences, requiring little to no user intervention
while being fully customisable. We compare the performance of several state of
the art tools for pairwise secondary structure alignment with \dotaligner , a
novel algorithm we developed that considers the ensemble of sub-optimal RNA
base pairings between two RNA sequences simultaneously. Through hierarchical
clustering and bootstrapping analysis, our method identifies statistically
significant clusters of homologous, structured RNA domains with no limitations
on the sequence composition of the input. We successfully identify known RNA
secondary structures mixed in with randomised controls, as well as novel
structured domains from various previously published transcriptomic datasets.}

\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}

\noindent The structure of RNA molecules is an essential functional criteria of
many non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as the stem-loop of microRNAs and the double
stem-loop RNA motifs of the HOTAIR long ncRNA \cite{Gupta20393566}. NcRNAs can
be divided in RNA families of similar inherent functionality, structures, or
composition. The largest collection of RNA families is the Rfam database with
2,208 families in its version 11.0 \cite{Burge23125362}. However, high-throughput
sequencing continuously uncovers novel non-coding RNA transcripts and
genome-wide RNA structure predictions have revealed hundreds of thousands
putative conserved RNA secondary structures. We hypothesize that the RNA
secondary structure is the scaffold for intermolecular interactions of many
ncRNA-driven regulatory pathways. Protein binding domains of RNA molecules may
evolve totally independent from sequence and, instead, may be solely determined
by structure. It has been shown that if the sequence similarity falls below 60\%
sequence comparison will not find anymore domain similarities that are based on
structure \cite{Gardner15860779}. In addition, competing structures and
suboptimal structures may support or even drive the functionality of an RNA
domain. Hence, methods are needed that find structural similarity independent
from sequence conservation and freed from one single optimal RNA secondary
structure.

For clustering of RNA domains a dissimilarity measurement of all pairs of query
structures is needed. The dissimilarity is described through a pairwise weighted
string alignment with arbitrary pairwise dependencies (for base pairings). The
Needleman-Wunsch (2) algorithm solves the maximum weight string alignment
problem by dynamic programming in $O(N^2)$ by preserving the sequence order and
maximizing the similarity. The consideration of pairs of nucleotides in each
sequence that form intra-molecular interactions extends the problem to pairwise
dependencies among positions in each string. This problem variant is
MAX-SNP-hard. However, the problem can be attacked by intelligent heuristics
that avoid the examination of all possible aligning states.

Simultaneous alignment and folding \cite{sankoff85} is the acknowledged gold
standard to predict the consensus structure and alignment of a set of related
RNA sequences. Because the Sankoff algorithm is practically not applicable, the
pre-calculation of the structure ensemble of each sequence, \eg{} basepair
probabilities in thermodynamically equilibrated RNA structure ensembles
\cite{McCaskill:1990}, is used by different methods to speed up the calculation
of structure-based alignments. The programs \pmcomp{} for pairwise and
\pmmulti{} for multiple alignments \cite{Hofacker15073017}, as well as
\locarna{} \cite{Will17432929} score the alignment based on the notion of a
common secondary structure. Despite of the usage of the basepair probability
matrices these methods extract the maximum-weight common secondary structure but
do not explicitely consider suboptimal structures in the alignment. The pairwise
alignment of basepair probability matrices (dot plots) has been first introduced
by \carna{} \cite{Palu2010,Sorescu2012}. \carna{} finds iterativelly better
alignments with an effective constraint programming technique using a branch and
bound scheme (propagator).

Beside of \locarna{} and a method based on directed acyclic graph kernels
\cite{Sato18647390}, the alignment-free approach \clustgraph{}
\cite{Heyne22689765} has been used to cluster RNA structure in common domains.
Here, we propose an alternative heuristic for the pairwise weighted string
alignment with arbitrary pairwise dependencies that can deliver dissimilarity
scores of dot plots in time close to an Needleman-Wunsch alignment which makes
the approach applicable for clustering of large numbers of putative RNA domains.


\section{\uppercase{Implementation}}

\noindent As described in \cite{Palu2010} the weight $W$ of alignment \emph{A}
of two arc-annotated sequences $(S_a,P_a)$ and $(S_b,P_b)$ is defined by

\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\begin{aligned}
	W(A) ={} & \sigma(A) + \tau(A) + \gamma(A) \\
	     ={} & \sum_{(i,i^\prime) \in A} \sigma(i,i^\prime) + \sum_{(i,j) \in
	P_a,\atop {(i^\prime,j^\prime) \in P_b,\atop {(i,i^\prime) \in
	A,\atop (j,j^\prime) \in A}}} \tau(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime) + \gamma
	\times N
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $S$ is a sequence and $P$ is a base pairing probability matrix,
$\sigma(i,i^\prime)$ is the similarity of sequence positions $S_a[i]$ and
$S_b[i^\prime]$, $\tau(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime)$ is the similarity of arcs $(i,j)
\in P_a$ and $(i^\prime,j^\prime) \in P_b$,
%$\tau(i,j,i^\prime,j^\primej,) = 1 - 2 \times |
%P_a(i,j)-P_b(i^\prime,j^\prime) |$)
and $\gamma$ is the gap cost associated with each sequence position that is not
matched ($N = |S_a|+|S_b|-2|A|$). The alignment problem finds the maximal
$W(A)$. As its solution is MAX-SNP-hard, in praxis heuristics are used to find
near-optimal solutions. Here, we present the program \dotaligner{} which solves
the related problem of aligning two basepair probability matrices (dot plots).
\dotaligner{} employs the heuristics alignment-envelope, which imposes
constraints to sub-optimal string alignments, and fold-envelope, which imposes
constraints to pre-calculated base pairing probabilities, to built
pairwise sequence-structure alignments. We make use of the observation that large
samples from the ensemble of stochastic sequence alignments contain the correct
structure-based alignment with significant probability even though the optimal
sequence alignment deviates significantly from the structural alignment
\cite{Muckstein12385998}. A major criteria for the implementation was a fast
running time to make \dotaligner{} applicable for RNA structure clustering of
large data sets. The alignment procedure consists of two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item pairwise probabilistic string alignments,
  \item stochastic backtracking of string alignments and combined
	  weight of corresponding dot plot alignments.
\end{enumerate}

In the following we describe the alignment procedure and its weight functions
implemented in \dotaligner{}.


\subsection{Pairwise probabilistic string alignments}

In step 1 the computation of the partition function over all canonical pairwise
string alignments is adapted from probA \cite{Muckstein12385998}. The
probability of an alignment $A$ in the ensemble of all alignments $Z(T)$ is

\begin{equation}\label{probA}
	Pr(A;T) = \frac{1}{Z(T)} exp(\beta W(A)),
\end{equation}

where $\beta = 1 / T$. The parameter $T$ is analogous to the temperature in the
thermodynamic interpretation of the alignment problem and determines the
relative importance of the optimal string alignment. If $T=1$ then we recover the
'true` probability, if $T\to0$ then $Pr(A;0)=0$ for all alignments with a score
$W(A)$ less then the score of the optimal string alignment, and if $T\to\infty$ then
all alignments have the same $Pr(A,\infty)=1/Z(\infty)$.  Hence, $T$ controls
the search space of suboptimal alignments for step 2. The algorithm runs in
$O(N^3)$ for calculating the partition function. The weight function $W(A)$ of
the probA implementation is changed to explore the ensemble of dot plot
alignments. We reduce the sequence-structure alignment problem to a
two-dimensional problem similar to the metric introduced in StrAL
\cite{Dalli16613908}. Hence, step 1 considers only the similarity $\sigma$ and
the gap cost $\gamma$ described in equation \ref{eq1}:

\begin{equation}\label{wstep1}
	W_{\mbox{Step1}}(A) = \sigma(A) + \gamma(A)
\end{equation}

The similarity $\sigma(i,i^\prime)$ for matched sequence positions $S_a[i]$ and
$S_b[i^\prime]$ takes into account sequence similarity $M_{Seq}$ and the
similarity in their unpaired probabilities $\Delta \omega(i,i^\prime)$ weighted
by the parameter $\theta$:

\begin{equation}\label{sigmam}
	\sigma(i,i^\prime) = \theta \times
		M_{Seq}^{(i,i^\prime)} + (1-\theta) \times \Delta \omega(i,i^\prime)
%	S_{Seq} = \sum_{(i,i^\prime) \in A} \tau \times M_{Seq}^{(i,i^\prime)} 
\end{equation}

$M_{Seq}^{(i,i^\prime)}$ is 1 if sequence positions $S_a[i]$ and
$S_b[i^\prime]$ match and else 0. The similarity of unpaired probabilities is
defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
	\Delta \omega(i,i^\prime) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
			0 & \textrm{if } \omega(i) == 0 \\
			  & \textrm{and } \omega(i^\prime ) == 0 \\
			1 - | \omega(i) - \omega(i^\prime) | & \textrm{else}
		\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

so that $\Delta \omega = (0,1)$. Alternatively a statistical substitution model
$R_{Seq}$ replaces the sequence similarity and is multiplied with the $\zeta$
weighted sum of $\Delta \omega$ and the similarity in ratios of upstream
pairing probability $\Delta \omega^{up}$:

\begin{equation}\label{sigmar}
\begin{aligned}
	\sigma(i,i^\prime) ={} & R_{Seq}^{(i,i^\prime)} \times \zeta \times \Delta \omega(i,i^\prime) +  \\
			       & R_{Seq}^{(i,i^\prime)} \times (1-\zeta) \times
	\Delta \omega^{up}(i,i^\prime)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

$R_{Seq}$ is a $4\times4$ matrix of probabilities for observing
a given substitution relative to background nucleotide frequencies. We use the
log-odd scores $L$ from the RIBOSUM85-60 matrix introduced in
\cite{Klein14499004} which are transformed to probabilities $R_{Seq}$ by
$2^{L(i,i^\prime)} / (1 + 2^{L(i,i^\prime)})$. The ratio of upstream pairing probability
$\omega^{up}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq5}
	\omega^{up}(i) = \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} \psi(k,i) /
	\sum_{k=1}^{|S|} \psi(k,i)
\end{equation}

where $i \in S$, $|S|$ is the length of sequence $S$, and $\psi(k,i)$ is the
pairing probability of sequence positions $S[k]$ and $S[i]$. The downstream
pairing probability is implicitly considered in the weight function through the
usage of unpaired probability and upstream pairing probability. The gap term
in equation \ref{eq1} is replaced with affine gap costs:

\begin{equation}\label{eq6}
	\gamma(A) = l \times g_o + (N-l) \times g_{ext}
\end{equation}
	
where $l$ is the number of initiation gaps, $N$ is the number of all gaps,
$g_o$ is the penalty for opening a gap and $g_{ext}$ is the penalty for gap
extensions. Start and end gaps are considered as free.


\subsection{Stochastic backtracking and combined weight of dot plot alignments}

In step 2 a properly weighted sample of stochastic pairwise string alignments
in the alignment ensemble is examined for their sequence-structure similarity.
The stochastic backtracking is adapted from probA \cite{Muckstein12385998} for
selecting $s$ suboptimal string alignments $A_s$.  The combined weight
$W_{\mbox{Step2}}$ is a variant of equation \ref{eq1} to explore the similarity
of the corresponding dot plot alignments:

\begin{equation}\label{eq7}
	W_{\mbox{Step2}}(A_s) = \kappa \times \frac{W_{\mbox{Step1}}(A_s)}{|A_s|} + (1-\kappa) \times
	\frac{\tau(A_s)}{{|\mbox{Match}_{A_s}|}^2}
\end{equation}

where the parameter $\kappa$ weights for each alignment $A_s$ between the
sequence-based similarity $W_{\mbox{Step1}}(A_s)$ normalized by alignment
length $|A_s|$ and dot plot similarity $\tau(A_s)$ normalized by the number of
aligned bases $|\mbox{Match}_{A_s}|$ in alignment $A_s$. Similar to equation
\ref{sigmam} the dot plot similarity $\tau$ sums the parameter $\theta$ weighted
similarity of aligned basepairs $M_{paired}$ and the similarity in their
pairing probabilities $\Delta \psi$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq8}
	\tau(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime) = \theta \times M_{paired}^{(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime)}
	+ (1-\theta) \times \Delta \psi(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime)
\end{equation}

where $M_{paired}^{(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime)}$ is 1 if $S_a[i]$ and $S_a[j]$ as
well as $S_b[i^\prime]$ and $S_b[j^\prime]$ form canonical basepairs (G-C, C-G,
A-U, U-A, G-U or U-G) and else 0. The similarity in pairing probabilities
$\Delta \psi$ is then calculate by

\begin{equation}\label{eq9}
	\Delta \psi(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
			0 \textrm{ if }\psi(i,j) == 0 
			  \textrm{ and }\psi(i^\prime,j^\prime) == 0 \\
		1 - | \psi(i,j) - \psi(i^\prime,j^\prime) | \textrm{ else}
		\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Similar to $M_{Seq}$ in equation \ref{sigmam} the basepair similarity matrix
$M_{paired}$ can be replaced by a statistical substitution model $R_{paired}$
which describes the probability for observing a given basepair substitution
relative to background nucleotide frequencies:

\begin{equation}\label{eq10}
	\tau(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime) = R_{paired}^{(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime)}
\times \Delta \psi(i,j,i^\prime,j^\prime)
\end{equation}

Again the log-odd scores $L$ from the RIBOSUM85-60 matrix \cite{Klein14499004}
are transformed to probabilities $R_{paired}$.

For both sequences $S_a$ and $S_b$, the pairing probability matrices $P_a$ and
$P_b$ are computed in advance using McCaskill's algorithm, implemented in
RNAfold or RNAplfold. The robustness of the alignment is improved by applying
log-odds scores $\psi$ of having a specific base pairing against the null model
of a random pairing \cite{Will17432929}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq11}
	\psi(i,j) = max \left( 0, log \frac{P(i,j)}{p_0} / log \frac{1}{p_0} \right)
\end{equation}

where $p_0$ is the expected probability for a pairing to occur at random. The
term $log \frac{1}{p_0}$ is a normalization factor that transforms the scores to
a maximum of 1. $P==1$ results in $\psi=1$, $P>p_0$ results in $\psi>0$, and $P\le
p_0$ results in $\psi=0$.  This transformation gives weaker similarities if low
basepair probabilities are compared, but stronger similarities for high basepair
probabilities. Unpaired probabilities are handled in a similar way by

\begin{equation}\label{eq12}
	\omega(i) = max \left( 0, log \frac{1 - \sum_k P(i,k)}{p_0} / log \frac{1}{p_0} \right)
\end{equation}

where $p_0$ is the expected probability for an unpaired base to occur at
random.


\section{\uppercase{Results}}

\noindent The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is assessed using the
specificity (SP) and the sensitivity (SN), which are defined as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq13}
	SP = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}, \hspace{5px} SN = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{equation}

where TP is the number of correctly predicted positives, FP is the number of
incorrectly predicted positives, TN is the number of correctly predicted
negatives, and FN is the number of incorrectly predicted negatives.
Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
was used to optimize the different combinations of parameters. The ROC curve
plots the true positive rates (SN) as a function of the false positive rates (1
- SP) for varying parameters.

\GRAY{As benchmark data set we selected 300 sequences of 10 H/ACA-box snoRNA families
from Rfam version 11.0 seed alignments with average pairwise sequence identity
(APSI) $< 90\%$ and sequence lengths of $>$ 130bp and $<$ 140bp: \emph{SNORA1},
\emph{SNORA13}, \emph{SNORA14}, \emph{SNORA15}, \emph{SNORA16}, \emph{SNORA17},
\emph{SNORA18}, \emph{SNORA19}, \emph{SNORA2}, \emph{SNORA22}. We chose only
sequences of similar length because step 1 of \dotaligner{} performs global
alignments.}


\subsection{Parameter optimization}

\noindent  The weight function of \dotaligner{} includes the following
parameters whose settings are discussed in this section:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\kappa$ is weight of sequence (string) similarity compared to structure (dot plot) similarity
	\item usage of similarity matrices $M_{seq}$ and $M_{paired}$ or statistical substitution matrices $R_{seq}$ and $R_{paired}$
	\item if similarity matrices $M_{seq}$ and $M_{paired}$ are used then $\theta$ is weight of sequence/basepair similarity compared to similarity of unpaired/pairing probability
	\item if substitution matrix $R_{seq}$ is used then $\zeta$ is weight of unpaired probability compared to ratio of upstream pairing probability 
	\item $g_o$ and $g_{ext}$ are the gap-open and gap-extension penalties respectively
	\item $s$ is number of examined suboptimal alignment
	\item $T$ is a measure of the relative importance of the optimal string alignment
	\item $p_0$ is minimal considered unpaired/pairing probability and set to 0.0005
\end{enumerate}

\GRAY{The ROC curve in Figure \ref{fig:roc} shows the lowest $\gamma$ as most
sensitive (SN $=$ 0.61) and the highest $\gamma$ as most specific (SP
$=$ 1.0) for correctly clustering the selected Rfam families. In the
following we choose $\gamma=4$, whereas the optimal gap cost lies
somewhere between 3 and 4.}

\subsection{Benchmarking methodology} 

\noindent The reliability of our pairwise structure alignment algorithm at
clustering homologous RNA structures was tested on a curated database of RNA
structure families (cf RFAM). This enables both qualitative and quantitative
performance evaluation using a gold-standard reference. We compared
\texttt{DotAligner} to other RNA structure alignment and clustering tools using
the following framework: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate dissimilarity matrix $dM_A$ from ${n(n-1)}\over{2}$ pairwise structure comparisons with each algorithm
\item Hierarchical clustering of RNA secondary structures and significance testing with \pvclust{} (Suzuki R and Shimodaira H. Bioinformatics 2006).
\item Generate dissimilarity matrix $dM_R$ from scoring metric of (1.) from curated RFAM alignments (constrained alignment). 
\item Calculate the correlation coefficient between $dM_A$ and $dM_R$ using the Mantel correlation statistic (the cross-product between the standardised distances). 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Benchmark data generation} 

\RED{Martins benchmark for different APSIs. Compare Rfam families with
significant clusters generated by \pvclust.}

Benchmarking was performed on both complete RNA structures (global alignment)
and randomly selected subsequences (local alignment) for various RFAM families,
as described below. \\

xx RNA families were manually selected from the seed alignments of RFAM 11
(REF). \textit{How should we limit the mean pairwise identity? All structures
must be within a given range and perform several independent comparisons, i.e.
one per SeqID range? Then compare the individual SeqID ranges to a sample of
variable SeqIDs (without selection)?}\\

We employed the BuildRfamBenchmark JAVA program from (Smith M et al. NAR 2013)
to generate the sample alignments for the RFAM entries listed in TableXX. The
tRNA sample includes special tRNAs, like ser-tRNA with a 5th hairpin to see how
the latter gets clustered by the algorithms. \\

\subsection{Fragmented RFAM sequences} 

Local alignment, simulating genomic screens. More emphasis on qualitative clustering


\subsection{ A unified RNA structure clustering pipeline }

\noindent We implemented a user-friendly pipeline that automates all steps required 
for the detection of homologous RNA secondary structure motifs from a set of user-
provided sequences. The pipeline is implemented in BASH programming language and is 
designed for execution on a high performance computing server (currently, only SGE 
is supported). This enables non-specialists to complete such an analysis with 
minimal bioinformatics knowledge, while facilitating parameter modification and 
customization for advanced users. 

In summary, the pipeline performs the following tasks on a fasta file input:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generates base-pairing probability matrices for each sequence with RNAfold's parition function algorithm 
\item Performs all-vs-all pairwise alignment in parallel with DotAligner (and/or CARNA, locarna, ....)
\item Generate (dis)similarity matrix from pairwise alignment scores 
\item Perform hierarchical clustering and bootstrap significance testing with \pvclust{} (Suzuki R and Shimodaira H. Bioinformatics 2006).
\item Extract the sequences and associated guide trees for significant clusters
\item Render a consensus secondary structure motif using the multiple structure alignment tool mlocarna
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{ On consensus hierarchical clustering }

We are investigating the practicality and efficiency of a consensus
hierarchical clustering approach, where the (dis)similarity matrices of
different pairwise structure alignment algorithms are concurrently employed for
cluster analysis. \textbf{This is cutting-edge stuff and Luis will report back
soon. }


\subsubsection{ On multiple structure alignment and 2D motif rendering }

Generating a multiple structural alignment at the end of the pipeline is an
important but tricky step.  Right now, we are using mlocarna for this, which to
my knowledge is the only tool that can produce such output without too much
fuss. However, there is a substantial concern that arises from its use:
\dotaligner and mlocarna use fundamentally different alignment algorithms. This
caveat is somewhat resolved by enforcing mlocarna to use the guide tree
produced from the all-vs-all (dis)similarity matrix from \dotaligner . Mlocarna
will still align the sequences based on their consensus structure, therefore
some additional benchmarking may be required. N.B., we can dictate which
pairwise aligner (or probabilistic aligner) to be used by mlocarna its
execution parameters, although mlocarna may ignore this when a guide-tree is
provided---thus employing locarna to produce intermediate alignments even when
only 2 sequences are involved. \textbf{CHECK THIS WITH SEBASTIAN WILL }

Some more specific points to consider: 
\begin{itemize}
\item --threads=X seemingly doesn't affect mlocarna performance. Is this only implemented for pairwise comparisons? 
Generating the intermediary alignments uses one CPU. Perhaps --cpu=X will work? 
\item RNAPLfold is used for longer input sequences, right? Is this because it overcomes sequence length discrepancies? 
Should we enfore a size limit on the input sequences (either trim or extend the input to XX nucleotides divergence)?
\item Try option \texttt{--pw-aligner path/to/DotAligner} and see if it will give more reliable consensus structure
\item Test whether the speed limitation of iterative refinement (\texttt{ --iterations=XX}) will be compensated by 
better quality alignments
\item Will this cause (m)locarna to use the entire dot plots for the alignment? Test the effect of the following 
parameters \texttt{--probabilistic --consistency-transformation --it-reliable-structure=XX}. 
\end{itemize} 
% --plfold-span=${SPAN} --plfold-winsize=${WINSIZE} \
% --probabilistic --consistency-transformation 
% --it-reliable-structure=10 


\section{\uppercase{Discussion}}

\noindent The application of \dotaligner{} is a fastly
calculated similarity score between two probability matrices to enable their
subsequent clustering.  Similar to \carna{}, which also does not garanty the
optimal solution, \dotaligner{} is not deterministic.

We plan to integrate the proposed method in a pipeline that screens regions of
interest for structured RNA domains in a collection of RNA molecules.  The so
far presented approach finds only global alignments. This strategy is
applicable for input sequences of similar lengths or if one sequence is
considerably shorter (due to the usage of free end gaps). However, local
alignment is favorable if both input sequences are long. Despite of the
partition function version of the local alignment problem is available, its
application dramatically increases the search space and, thus, the running
time. \RED{As alternative, a possible screening pipeline may comprise window
based thermodynamic folding, \eg{} by \rnaplfold{}
\cite{Bernhart:Hofacker:Stadler:Local_RNA_base:2006}, and filter regions of
high intra-molecular binding probabilities in a pre-processing step, \eg{} by
using \rnalocal{} \cite{Dotu19908358}, followed by the presented alignment tool
\dotaligner. SHOULD WE INCLUDE THIS ANALYSIS IN THIS PAPER AND IF YES WHERE?}
The pre-selection of local structural potential may improve the boundaries of
common structured RNA domain. 

\dotaligner{} can also be extended for multiple alignments, similar to the strategy
implemented in \pmmulti{} \cite{Hofacker15073017}, and the generation of
phylogenetic trees. This may replace or support the hierarchical clustering
approach used here. In addition, both may serve as input for RNA secondary
structure predictors, such as \petfold{} \cite{Seemann2008} unifying
thermodynamic and evolutionary information.
